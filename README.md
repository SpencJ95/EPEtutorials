## MacOS/Linux Installation
MacOS and Linus already come with Python already installed, so there are only two packages that need to be installed: git and anaconda. To install anaconda, open a Terminal/Console window and paste ```pip install anaconda```. Press enter to run the command. For git, you need to first download the installer found [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
