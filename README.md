## MacOS/Linux Installation
MacOS and Linus already come with Python already installed, so there are only two packages that need to be installed: git and anaconda.
* To install anaconda, open a Terminal/Console window and paste ```pip install anaconda```. Press enter to run the command.  
* For git, you need to first download the installer found [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Then, open the .dmg file and double click on the .pkg file. If you get a warning saying it canâ€™t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer, go to your System Preferences -> Security and Privacy and click on "open anyway." Follow the rest of the installer instructions to finish installing git.
