## Git Installation

To install git, go to [this website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the installer for your operating system. If you do not already have a bash shell installed, make sure to also choose that option for install as git is a terminal application.

On Mac, if you get a warning saying the .pkg file canâ€™t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer, go to your System Preferences -> Security and Privacy and click on "open anyway." Follow the rest of the installer instructions to finish installing git.

## Anaconda Installation
To install anaconda, first go to [this website](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), and download either the graphical installer for Python 3 Once downloaded, follow the install wizard. The default settings are usually good choices. Make sure to choose Anaconda's python kernel as default, as it makes using the different frameworks and plugins much easier.

If you already have pip and Python 3 installed, you can run ```pip3 install anaconda``` in bash to get Anaconda.

## After installation
Once you have successfully installed git and anaconda, go to [the first lesson, 00-packages.ipynb](https://github.com/vladov3000/EPEtutorials/blob/master/00-packages.ipynb). If you ever get stuck at a section in these tutorials, remember that it is ok to ask somebody for help. Everyone was once where you are now. Good Luck!
