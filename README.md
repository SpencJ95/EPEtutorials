## MacOS/Linux Installation
MacOS and Linus already come with Python already installed, so there are only two packages that need to be installed: git and anaconda.
* To install anaconda, open a Terminal/Console window and paste ```pip install anaconda```. Press enter to run the command. For Linux if you do not have pip, got to [this website](https://www.tecmint.com/install-pip-in-linux/) and type in the appropriate command for your linux version and python 3.
* For git, you need to first download the installer found [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Then, open the .dmg file and double click on the .pkg file. If you get a warning saying it canâ€™t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer, go to your System Preferences -> Security and Privacy and click on "open anyway." Follow the rest of the installer instructions to finish installing git.

## Windows Installation
Windows users will need to install two things, git and anaconda.
* To install anaconda, first go to [this website](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), and download either the 64-bit or 32-bit graphical installer for Python 3.7, depending on your version of Windows. Once downloaded, follow the install wizard. The default settings are usually good choices. Make sure to choose Anaconda's python kernel, as it makes using the different frameworks and plugins much easier.
* To install git, go to [this website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the windows installation. If you do not already have a bash shell installed, make sure to also choose that option for install as git is a terminal application.

## After installation
Once you have successfully installed these pieces, go to [the first lesson, 00-packages.ipynb](https://github.com/vladov3000/EPEtutorials/blob/master/00-packages.ipynb). If you ever get stuck at a section in these tutorials, remember that it is ok to ask somebody for help. Everyone was once where you are now. Good Luck!
